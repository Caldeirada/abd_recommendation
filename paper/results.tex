\section{Results}
\label{results}

To get our final results we selected the columns we wanted and then we removed the duplicates since it doesn't make
sense to have a basket with an item repeated. 

We did some tables with the information we think it will be most useful and even created a new column where we aggregated
the brand and category_id. We also separated the views and purchases since we think it is useful to know which items
people really bought and the ones they only viewed.

Then we wrote this tables to different files using parquet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item user_products, user_id | product_id where event_type = purchase, 
    \item user_products_v, user_id | product_id where event_type = view 
    \item user_brands user_id, | brand where event_type = purchase
    \item user_brands_v, user_id | brand where event_type = view
    \item user_categories, user_id | category_id where event_type = purchase
    \item user_categories_v, user_id | category_id where event_type = view
    \item user_category_brand, user_id | brand_category where event_type = purchase
    \item user_category_brand_v, user_id | brand_category where event_type = view
    \item session_products, user_session | product_id where event-type = purchase, 
    \item session_products_v, user_session | product_id where event_type = view 
    \item session_brands, user_session | brand where event_type = purchase
    \item session_brands_v, user_session | brand where event_type = view
    \item session_categories user_session | category_id where event_type = purchase
    \item session_categories_v user_session | category_id where event_type = view
\end{itemize}
