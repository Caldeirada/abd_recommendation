\section{Results}
\label{results}

The results we've got were obtained through the analysis of the FPGrowth algorithm which is similar to the apriori one.

To get our final results we selected the columns we wanted and then we removed the duplicates since it doesn't make
sense to have a basket with an item repeated. 

Then we wrote the information to different files using parquet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item user_products, user_id | product_id where event-type = purchase, 
    \item user_products_v, user_id | product_id where event_type = view 
    \item user_brands user_id | brand where event_type = purchase
    \item user_brands_v user_id | brand where event_type = view
    \item user_categories user_id | category_id where event_type = purchase
    \item user_categories_v user_id | category_id where event_type = view
    \item session_products, user_session | product_id where event-type = purchase, 
    \item session_products_v, user_session | product_id where event_type = view 
    \item session_brands user_session | brand where event_type = purchase
    \item session_brands_v user_session | brand where event_type = view
    \item session_categories user_session | category_id where event_type = purchase
    \item session_categories_v user_session | category_id where event_type = view
\end{itemize}
