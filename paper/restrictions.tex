\section{Restrictions}
\label{restrictions}

The dataset has a defined structure, however, it was necessary to include some restrictions in order to guarantee the best performance for the algorithm to be implemented.
On the other hand, some of the columns were not necessary for the recommendation system.
First, three columns were excluded:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{event\_time} - These data are not used to our the recommendation system, since they only tell us the time of the event.
    As the data we have is only two months old, we do not feel the need to use this column.
    The \textbf{user\_session} field also gives us a sense of the time of the event.
    \item \textbf{category\_code} - This field is a repeat of the \textbf{category\_id}.
    In order not to have redundant information, we decided to exclude it from our dataset.
    \item \textbf{price} - This data is not relevant for our recommendation system.
    The main focus is to establish a relationship between users the products / categories they prefer.
\end{itemize}

In the \textbf{event\_type} field, there can be 4 possible values (view, cart, remove\_from\_cart, purchase).
For this project we just decided to consider the events of \textbf{view} and \textbf{purchase} type, where the purchase is more relevant, that is, is recommended a product that was more often purchased than a product that was seen more often.
