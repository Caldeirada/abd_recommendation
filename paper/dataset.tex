\section{Dataset}
\label{dataset}

For a recommendation system, the dataset must follow some criteria, such as an evaluation system, where it is possible to create a relationship between users and items.
For this project, we chose a dataset collected by Open CDP from an eCommerce store with more than 15 million visitors per month.
