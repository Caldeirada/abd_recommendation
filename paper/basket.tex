\section{Market-Basket Model}
\label{basket}

The market-basket model is used to describe a many-to-many relation between items and baskets and
we decided to go with this model for our recommendation system since this model was the closest to
the dataset we got.
In our case the items are the products that eCommerce users can purchase and see,
baskets are a set of those products and our data is represented by a sequence of baskets.
